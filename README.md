# Excursion
## Aim
A project set by Codecademy as part of the full stack path. Create a simple webpage given the [design mockup](https://github.com/GNolanDev/excursion/blob/main/design_brief/excursion_redline.png).
## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
## Requirements
Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://gnolandev.github.io/excursion/), but will run on any modern browser by downloading all files to the same directory and opening _index.html_.
## Other
Note: good learning point - embedded <video>s will not autoplay unless you also set the 'muted' attribute. Good to know!
After meeting(?) the design brief, I realised it looked a bit awful in smaller screen sizes, so took the chance to add a bit of responsive code. The fixed font-sizes in pixels are switched to descriptive sizes (larg/x-large etc), image is swapped out, and maximum screen widths are applied once the screen width drops below 1000px.
Thanks to [Resize Pixel](https://www.resizepixel.com) for the online image resizing utility - really easy to use.
## Screenshots
Screen-widths of: 1600/1100/900/650/450/350 pixels
